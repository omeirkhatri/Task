# INSTRUCTIONS: 
# - email_jsonb: Just type email address(es). For multiple emails, separate with semicolon (e.g., "john@example.com" or "john@example.com;jane@example.com")
# - phone_jsonb: Just type phone number(s) in quotes to prevent Excel from converting to scientific notation. For multiple phones, separate with semicolon (e.g., "971551010743" or "971551010743;971501234567")
#   Note: Always put phone numbers in quotes in Excel to prevent scientific notation. Excel may remove + prefix - that's OK, just type numbers (e.g., "971551010743" instead of "+971 55 101 0743")
